Description: A toolbox for analyzing and simulating large networks based on hierarchical exponential-family random graph models (HERGMs).'bigergm' implements the estimation for large networks efficiently building on the 'lighthergm' and 'hergm' packages. Moreover, the package contains tools for simulating networks with local dependence to assess the goodness-of-fit.
